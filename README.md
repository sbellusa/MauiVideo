## Introduction

The Movie Display Application is a web-based application that allows users to view details of their favorite movies. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to explore a vast collection of movies, including information about movie titles, genres, release dates, and more.

This project was created because of a challenge to showcase a small .NET MAUI app using a public API. It is designed to demonstrate .NET MAUI native implementation features, following best practises, in order to run on iOS, Android and Windows machines. 

All API data comes from The Movie Database:
```bash
https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs
```

## Features
